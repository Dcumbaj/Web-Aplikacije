			<p>Valve's debut title, Half-Life, was released in 1998. It won more than 50 game of the year awards, and PC Gamer even called it the Best PC Game Ever. Since then, we've released dozens of titles that changed the world (and one that didn't). Today, millions of people play our games every day.</p>
			<p>Our earlier titles were built on an innovative engine with world-class gameplay as their paramount goal, and praised by critics as games that revitalized or even invented their genres</p>
			<p>We created Steam in 2003 to serve as a digital content distribution channel, before app stores existed. It's since grown and evolved into a platform for thousands of creators and publishers to deliver content and establish direct relationships with their customers. The Steam Community enables millions of players to do likewise, sharing entertainment and ideas, and making friends.</p>
			<p>We make consumer electronic devices that improve gaming on the PC. Things like the Steam Controller and the Steam Link. We invented the VR technologies that power the Vive, an interactive VR system brought to market in partnership with HTC. Just as in software development, we conduct playtests and share prototypes with our partners and players. We follow the results of this work all the way through the manufacturing process to create products people are sure to enjoy.</p>
			<p>We make all of this stuff collaboratively in Bellevue, Washington, where we combine the resources and talent of a world-class company with the ethos of a small startup. With an engaged and vocal community of partners and players, our products and our company will continue to change and grow in ways we may never have predicted. Join us, and help inform what's next.</p>
